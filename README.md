# Retryer
# Design Patterns in Typescript

As with most things in development best practices, the design patterns suggested in OOP can be very powerful. They can also be overkill or just a waste of time, depending on the problem you are trying to solve or the code base you are working with. And, of course, they can be misunderstood and done badly. 

Instead of trying to crowbar some patterns into a random part of the code-base, I looked for a genuine use case where the result would be of benefit. I needed a piece of code that was repeated in several places but with only slight differences in operation. I wanted to find a piece of functionality that could be clearly encapsulated and abstracted out to a pattern. Ah-ha, here we go...

## The Opportunity

Within our client code, we call multiple distinct APIs. As we should with all distributed software we expect and prepare for errors.

There are two kinds of errors with a call to an external service; transient or fatal. To handle a transient error it is a good idea to just try again as the system on the other end may recover and return the results you need. We don't want to keep retying forever and different cases call for different retry policies. For instance, you might want to wait longer periods between retrying or limit the number of times you retry. 

Here is an example of a call to an endpoint with a payload using the node library `axios`.

```typescript
async function callAPI(
    endpoint: string,
    payload: ReqDate,
): Promise<results> {
        try {
            const result = await axios.post(
                endpoint,
                {
                    ...payload,
                },
                request_config // env var
            );
            if (result && result.data) {
                return result.data;
            }
        } catch (err) {
                log(err);
        }
    }
}
```

The `apiCall` function is used in a few different places and may or may not return results. 

This function does one thing (another suggested best practise). It tries to call an endpoint and throws an error if it goes wrong. The only problem here is we would need to retry if there is a transient error. Adding some logic to achieve this retrying gives us;

```typescript
async function callAPI(
    endpoint: string,
    payload: IReqDate,
): Promise<results> {
    const max_tries = 3;
    const wait = 1500;
    for (let attempt_count = 1; attempt_count <= max_tries; attempt_count++) {
        try {
            const result = await axios.post(
                endpoint,
                {
                    ...payload,
                },
                request_config
            );
            if (result && result.data) {
                return result.data;
            }
        } catch (err) {
            if (err.response && err.response.status >= 400) {
                throw err;
            }
            await delay(wait); // A helper function that sets a timeout
        }
    }
}
```

This code will now retry if it results in a temporary error and there is a chance the other service will recover. It is very specific to the retry policy. You can now only use this function in certain cases, that being when you want to retry in constant intervals and a certain number of times. As I said earlier, there are a lot of places we call APIs and with the above approach they will all need their own implementation of this retry logic. 

I decided to see if I could improve this and abstract the retry code out so that it  could be reused. Is there are way to separate the retry and the calling code?

I spoke with a senior engineer within my company and he paired with me to create a solution that would be easily testable as well as encapsulated.

## Retry Policy - Strategy Pattern

> Strategy is a behavioural design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.
>

In our example, the family of algorithms are different retry policies. 

First, we designed an interface for the policies;

```typescript
export interface Ipolicy {
    maxTries: number;
    currentWait: () => number;
    shouldRetry: () => boolean;
    incrementTry: () => void;
}
```

This interface doesn't restrict the class that implements it to only have these properties and methods, just that they should have *at least* these public members. It can have as much extra functionality as needed to fulfil the job of retrying a given command.

The idea behind doing this is so that we can write as many different policy classes as we need and as long as they implement this interface they will work with our new retry code. Their public facing APIs mean they can be used interchangeably with other classes the implement this interface.

Most times when retrying you would want to wait some time between retries. The simplest example would be to just wait a set amount of time each retry. In this example the default is 500ms and the number of times to try before giving up is 5;

```typescript
export class ConstantPolicy implements Ipolicy {
    private retryCount: number;
    constructor(public maxTries: number = 5, private initWaitTime: number = 500) {
        this.retryCount = 0;
    }
    currentWait() {
        return this.initWaitTime;
    }
    shouldRetry(err) {
        if (err.response && err.response.status >= 400) {
            return false
        } else if (this.retryCount < this.maxTries) {
            return true;
        } 
        return false;
    }
    incrementTry() {
        this.retryCount++;
    }
}
```

Another strategy we could take with retries is to back off trying exponentially longer each time;

```typescript
export class ExpoPolicy implements Ipolicy {
    private retryCount: number;
    constructor(public maxTries: number = 5, private initWaitTime: number = 500) {
        this.retryCount = 0;
    }
    currentWait() {
        return Math.pow(this.initWaitTime, this.retryCount);
    }
    shouldRetry(err) {
        if (err.response && err.response.status >= 400) {
            return false
        } else if (this.retryCount < this.maxTries) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
    incrementTry() {
        this.retryCount++;
    }
}
```

You can see that both of these classes have a `currentWait()` method but that they calculate that time differently. The code using this class doesn't need to know how this number is calculated or even which one of these 2 classes it is using. As long as there is a `currentWait()` method and it returns a `number` that can be used to set a timeout it will work. 

This policy has all we need to know when retrying a call. The `shouldRetry()`method checks if we have reached the max number of times to try returning `false` if we has. Also, there is a method that increment the try count. This logic can be much more complicated of course with the `currentWait` returning exponentially larger times and so on.

How do we use this?

```typescript 
const policy = new ConstantPolicy();
```
This functionality is now encapsulated and can/should be tested and in all ways.

```typescript
describe('constantPolicy', function() {
    it('should be a policy', function() {
        const pol = new ConstantPolicy();
        const pol0 = new ConstantPolicy(0);
        const pol1 = new ConstantPolicy(1);

        assert.equal(pol.currentWait(), 500);
        assert.ok(pol.shouldRetry());
        assert.equal(pol0.shouldRetry(), false);
        assert.ok(pol1.shouldRetry());
        pol1.incrementTry();
        assert.equal(pol1.shouldRetry(), false);
    });
});
```
We can pass in the policy to a function that takes it and a command to retry. 

## Retryer

As I tried to implement the `retryer` function I soon realised that it was clumsy passing in the function to be retried along with its arguments. 

```typescript
retryer(fn, args, policy);
```

This seems ok but what if the `fn` takes no arguments? To not confuse the `retryer` you would need to pass `null` at that position. I think we can all agree that would be ugly!

One idea would be to use a lambda;

```typescript
retryer(() => fn(args), policy);
```

This is a clear solution, but as we are looking at the Design Patterns it would be nice to complete this solution with another pattern. Also, so that it can be truly reusable we should make it so that it can take an arbitrarily complex command.

## Command Pattern

> Command is a behavioural design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you parameterize methods with different requests, delay or queue a requestâ€™s execution, and support undo-able operations.

I needed a way to encapsulate the function to be (re)tried. There is, of course, a pattern for that. It means we can hide the function behind a generic interface so that it can be used uniformly where ever we want without having to make any changes. This approach also means that the command can be as complex or as simple as needed without having to change the Retryer implementation. 

Here is the interface;

```typescript
interface ICommand { 
    execute();
}
```

It has one public method, `execute()`, that will run the code.

```typescript
class Command<T> implements ICommand {
    constructor(private fn: () => Promise<T>) {}

    public async execute(): Promise<T> {
        return await this.fn();
    }
}
```

This is about as simple as you can get. The object returned by this class, when executed, will call the function. This is a minor abstraction over just calling the function, but gives us a lot of flexibility. Again this can be easily tested in isolation. 

This command interface has only one requirement. An execute method. For our use case, this is simple but it can be anything that needs doing (executing). 

This command class makes it easy to encapsulate our function.

```typescript
const command = new Command(fn);
```

Refactoring our original example to use the command pattern would look something like;

```typescript
class ApiCommand<T, U> implements ICommand {
    constructor(private fn: (endpoint: string, payload: T) => Promise<U>, private endpoint: string, private payload: T) {}
     
    public async execute(): Promise<U> {
        return await this.fn(this.endpoint, this.payload);
    }
}

const apiCommand = new ApiCommand(callAPI: function, endpoint: string, payload: payload)
```

and now the Retryer function call is much clearer;

```typescript
retryer(command, policy);
```

Here is one way you could use these classes in a Retryer function;

```typescript
async function retryer(command: ICommand, policy: Ipolicy) {
    while (true) {
        try {
            policy.incrementTry();
            return await command.execute();
        } catch (error) {
            if (policy.shouldRetry(err)) {
                await delay(policy.currentWait());
            } else {
                return; // Handle fatal error!
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This function makes it clear why we programmed to the interfaces. Any class that implements the `Ipolicy` and `ICommand` interfaces will work here, which means it is reusable. The policy can have any functionality it needs to decide if `shouldRetry()` returns true or false and how long each `currentWait()` should be. 

Putting this all together would look like;

```typescript
// The function to be tried
async function callAPI(
    endpoint: string,
    payload: ReqDate,
): Promise<results> {
        try {
            const result = await axios.post(
                endpoint,
                {
                    ...payload,
                },
                request_config
            );
            if (result && result.data) {
                return result.data;
            }
        } catch (err) {
                log(err);
        }
    }
}

class ApiCommand<T, U> implements ICommand {
    constructor(private fn: (endpoint: string, payload: T) => Promise<U>, private endpoint: string, private payload: T) {}
     
    public async execute(): Promise<U> {
        return await this.fn(this.endpoint, this.payload);
    }
}

export class ConstantPolicy implements Ipolicy {
    private retryCount: number;
    constructor(public maxTries: number = 5, private initWaitTime: number = 500) {
        this.retryCount = 0;
    }
    currentWait() {
        return this.initWaitTime;
    }
    shouldRetry(err) {
        if (err.response && err.response.status >= 400) {
            return false
        } else if (this.retryCount < this.maxTries) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
    incrementTry() {
        this.retryCount++;
    }
}

async function retryer(command: ICommand, policy: Ipolicy) {
    while (true) {
        try {
            policy.incrementTry();
            return await command.execute();
        } catch (error) {
            if (policy.shouldRetry(err)) {
                await delay(policy.currentWait());
            } else {
                return;
            }
        }
    }
}

const policy = new ConstantPolicy()

const endpoint = 'v1/mickey/mouse'

const payload = {id: 1, ears: 'big', braces: true}
 
const apiCommand = new ApiCommand(callAPI, endpoint, payload)

let result;
try {
    result = await retryer(apiCommand, policy)
} catch(err) {
    log(err);
}
```
Rather than re implementing the retry logic each time and mixing this logic in with what ever is being retried we can separate things making it easier to test, easier to reuse and easier to change in future.

For instance, when you realise that waiting 500ms each time is not the correct thing to do here you can change the policy without changing any other code. 

```typescript
const policy = new ExpoPolicy();
```

Then you realise that actually you need to randomise the delay between calls to stop lots of calls retrying at the same time;

```typescript
const policy = new JitterPolicy();
```

Oh, you know what? We need these waits to not exceed our SLAs;

```typescript
const policy = new SlaPolicy();
```

As you can see, these patterns are useful for making code reusable and more generic so that one piece of code can be used to solve more problems. When the code-base is all like this it means getting more done with less lines of code. Less lines of code means less places for bugs!
